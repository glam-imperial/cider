# COVID-19 Identification ResNet (CIdeR)

Repo for the classification of COVID-19 using cough and breath audio samples from [End-2-End COVID-19 Detection from Breath & Cough Audio](https://innovations.bmj.com/content/bmjinnov/7/2/356.full.pdf).

## Contents:

**[main](main.py)** --> Script for orchestrating training and testing of model.\
**[data_preprocessing](data_preprocessing.py)** --> Loads and and performs all preprocessing of data.\
**[conv_model](conv_model.py)** --> code for CIdeR
**[Train/Validaiton/Test splits](paths/cross_val/)** --> The train/validation/test splits used in the paper.\
**[dev_test_train_check](dev_test_train_check.py)** --> Tests to make sure no leakage of users between train/val/test splits occurs.\
**[args](args.txt)** --> The hyperparams of the final model.\
**[create_csv](create_csv.py)** --> code used to create train/validation/test splits. *note: running this file will overwrite the splits used in this work and so if any comparision is to be made, do not run this script*

## Replication of Results
For privacy reasons we do not release the trained models however, we can provide them on request. Requests to harry.coppock@imperial.ac.uk

To train or evalute the model first install the required packages:
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To train and evaluate the model with the hyperparams defined in [args.txt](args.txt) simply run:
```sh
python main.py
```
If you would like to evaluate an existing trained model:
```sh
python main.py --do_train False --saved_model_dir pathtothesavedmodel 
```
